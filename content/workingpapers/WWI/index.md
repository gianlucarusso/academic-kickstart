## Abstract

One of the key steps that allowed Mussolini to become the Italian *Duce* was the victory in the 1924 national elections.
I study the impact of World War I on Mussolini's electoral success. I reconstruct the military death rate for the universe of Italian municipalities, which is matched to municipal level voting in the 1924 election.
Controlling for the number of military drafted in an Italian municipality, variation in the share of fatalities is induced by military events exogenous to municipality characteristics that could simultaneously affect support for Fascism.
I find that a higher share of fatalities increases the vote share for Fascism. More than half of the increase in the vote share for Mussolini is matched by a decrease in the vote share of the Socialist party.
I decompose my analysis by the intensity of the fatality rate to show persuasive evidence that the number of fatalities interacted positively with the number of veterans back from the frontline. I show that the effect of fatalities is driven by municipalities that in 1921 had above median vote shares for the Socialist party.
This is consistent with historical narratives arguing that the initial rise of Mussolini was facilitated and acclaimed by the "red menace", i.e. the fear of a Socialist revolution in Italy.
