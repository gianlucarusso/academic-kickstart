## Abstract

In this paper, I argue that exposure to mainstream mass media facilitates immigrants' assimilation. I exploit the rise and expansion of radio broadcasting in the United States after the Age of Mass Migration ended to identify the effect of radio exposure on immigrants' assimilation.
I reconstruct exogenous exposure to radio networks using a novel propagation model suitable to AM radio, the only radio technology available at the time.
Exploiting the US full count census, I find that radio networks had a strong effect on immigrants' assimilation. Immigrants exposed to radio networks exerted higher effort to assimilate by naming their children with less distinctively foreign names and by becoming US citizens more often. Exposure to US radio networks also increased the likelihood of marrying a US citizen from US-born parents. Using names from baseball players, I show that aspiration might have been a key mechanism to explain why radio promoted assimilation. Immigrant households named their children exclusively after players that performed particularly well during the season, suggesting they were ''naming for success.''
