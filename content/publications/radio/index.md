## Abstract

The advent of the radio networks in the early twentieth century marked the inception
of the first national media platform in US history. This development coincided
with the conclusion of the Age of Mass Migration, a historical period characterized by
record-high diversity within the US society. How did the sudden rise of national radio
networks affect the assimilation of millions of immigrants in the US? I answer this
question by building quasi-random variation in the initial expansion of radio networks
coverage. Through the application of a difference-in-difference design and leveraging
evidence from diverse samples, I document that higher exposure to radio networks
facilitated immigrant assimilation across various outcomes, including higher rates of
intermarriage with natives, increased naturalization, and a greater propensity to adopt
names that sounded less foreign. Additionally, I find that exposure to radio networks
led to enhanced English proficiency among recently arrived immigrants. I argue that a
key channel of assimilation was through the impact of role models on the media. Using
data on baseball, I show that immigrants perceived baseball players as media role
models of assimilation. Immigrant households were more likely to name their children
after baseball players who shared similar ancestral origins to them or who achieved
notable success during a season.
