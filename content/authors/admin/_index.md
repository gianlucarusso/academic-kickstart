Welcome to my website! Starting September I will be a postdoctoral fellow at Universitat Pompeu Fabra working with [Maria Petrova](https://sites.google.com/site/mariapetrovaphd/) under her ERC grant EXTREME *"The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism"*.

I hold a PhD in Economics from Boston University where I graduated in May 2020.

In my research I use historical data and historical natural experiments to answer questions from the political economy and development literature.
