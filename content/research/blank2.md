**Voting Behavior and Mass Media: Radio Networks in the United States, 1925-1940**


**Outmigration and Economic Development: Evidence from the Italian Mass Migration** (Joint with Nicola Fontana, Marco Manacorda and Marco Tabellini)



<!-- In his seminal contribution, Stromberg (2004) argues that radio ownership had a positive impact on political turnout during the interwar period. In this paper, I document that higher turnout was driven by the access to national radio networks, the first uniform media platform of American history. While radio networks transmitted content of national relevance, non affiliated stations predominantly targeted local matters. Exploiting the gradual rule out of radio signal in the country, I find that exogenous network access increased congressional and presidential turnout by 2 and 3 percentage points respectively. The same treatment reduced political competition between democrats and republicans. I suggest that my results are driven by the homogenization of counties political behavior towards the national averages induced by radio networks. While access to non-affiliated stations had little to no effect on turnout and competition, national radio networks reduced the gap between county level turnout and competition and the national averages. -->



<!-- How does mass outmigration affect short and long run economic development? We answer this question in the context of the Italian diaspora between 1875 and 1920, when nine million Italians – or, one third of Italy’s 1900 population – left the country for the United States, Canada, and Latin America. To do so, we collect and digitize a large number of datasets on yearly migration from each municipality as well as censuses of manufacturing and agriculture. Combining them with more recent datasets, we can trace out the effects of emigration at the municipality level for the entire century. To identify the causal impact of emigration, we predict the total number of migrants from each Italian municipality between 1900 and 1920 by combining variation in pre-1900 connections between Italian municipalities and US counties with the differential economic attractiveness of US counties after 1900. Preliminary results show that the 1900-1920 cumulative mass-emigration had a negative and strong effect on different measures of economic development, such as industrial production, manufacturing employment, and population growth. However, such negative effects become quantitatively large and statistically significant only after the 1950s, suggesting a potential interaction between historical emigration and structural transformation that took place in Italy after WWII. -->
